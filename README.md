## Text-to-CAD

### Overview  
This converts natural language into dimensionally accurate CAD models, enabling rapid prototyping for engineers, designers, and makers.

---


### Features  
- 🧠 **LLM-powered prompt interpretation**  
- 📐 **Accurate CAD model generation**  
- 🖼️ **Interactive 3D visualization** with PyVista in Streamlit  
- ⚡ **One-click STL export** for rapid fabrication workflows  

---

### How It Works  
1. Enter a design prompt in natural language  
2. The system generates a CAD script and converts it into an STL  
3. Visualize the output in-browser with full 3D interaction  
4. Download and fabricate directly

### Getting Started  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PrintX.git
cd PrintX
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run PrintX.py
```

🔑 **Note**: You must set your OpenAI API key in the script.
